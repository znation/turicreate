/**
\ingroup group_serialization
\brief A macro which disables the serialization of type so that 
it will fault at runtime. 

Writing TURI_UNSERIALIZABLE(T) for some typename T in the global namespace
will result in an assertion failure if any attempt is made to serialize or
deserialize the type T.  This is largely used for debugging purposes to enforce
that certain types are never serialized.
