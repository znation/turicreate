/**
 * ------------------------
 * Kmeans clustering model
 * ------------------------
 *
 * Kmeans clustering model. By default, the model uses the KMeans++ algorithm to
 * choose initial cluster centers, although users may also pass custom initial
 * centers. This implementation uses the implementation of Elkan (2003), which
 * takes advantage of the triangle inequality to reduce the number of distance
 * computations. In addition to storing the n x 1 vectors of cluster assignments
 * and distances from each point to its assigned cluster center (necessary for
 * any Kmeans implementation), the Elkan algorithm also requires computation and
 * storage of all pairwise distances between cluster centers.
 *
 * \note This implementation does *not* currently use the second lemma from the
 * Elkan (2003) paper, which further reduces the number of exact distance
 * computations by storing the lower bound on the distance between every point
 * and every cluster center. This n x K matrix is generally too big to store in
 * memory and too slow to write to as an SFrame.
 *
 * The Kmeans model contains the following private data objects:
 *
 *  mldata: The data, in ml_data_2 form. Each row is an observation. After the
 *    model is trained, this member is no longer needed, so it is not serialized
 *    when the model is saved.
 *
 *  num_examples: Number of points.
 *
 *  assignments: Cluster assignment for each data point.
 *
 *  clusters: Vector of cluster structs, each of which contains a center vector,
 *    a count of assigned points, and a mutex lock, so the cluster can safely be
 *    updated in parallel.
 *
 *  num_clusters: Number of clusters, set by the user.
 *
 *  max_iterations: Maximum iterations of the main Kmeans loop, excluding
 *    initial selection of the centers.
 *
 *  upper_bounds: For every point, an upper bound on the distance from the point
 *    to its currently assigned center. Whenever the distance between a point
 *    and its assigned center is computed exactly, then this bound is tight, but
 *    the bounds also must be adjusted at the end of each iteration to account
 *    for the movement of the assigned center. Despite this adjustment, the
 *    upper bound often remains small enough to avoid computing the exact
 *    distance to other candidate centers.
 *
 *  center_dists: Exact distance between all pairs of cluster centers. Computing
 *    this K x K matrix allows us to use the triangle inequality to avoid
 *    computing all n x K point-to-center distances in every iteration.
 *
 *
 * The Kmeans model stores the following members in its *state* object, which is
 * exposed to the Python API:
 *
 *  options: Option manager which keeps track of default options, current
 *    options, option ranges, type etc. This must be initialized only once in
 *    the init_options() function.
 *
 *  training_time: Run time of the algorithm, in seconds.
 *
 *  training_iterations: Number of iterations of the main Kmeans loop. If the
 *    algorithm does not converge, this is equal to 'max_iterations'.
 *
 *
 * In addition, the following public methods return information from a trained
 * Kmeans model:
 *
 *  get_cluster_assignments: Returns an SFrame with the fields "row_id",
 *    "cluster_id", and "distance" for input data point. The "cluster_id" field
 *    (integer) contains the cluster assignment of the data point, and the
 *    "distance" field (float) contains the Euclidean distance of the data point
 *    to the assigned cluster's center.
 *
 *  get_cluster_info: Returns an SFrame with metadata about each cluster. For
 *    each cluster, the output SFrame includes the features describing the
 *    center, the number of points assigned to the cluster, and the
 *    within-cluster sum of squared Euclidean distances from points to the
 *    center.
