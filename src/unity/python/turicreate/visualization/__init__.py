Turi Create Visualization allows you to create, view, and save Plot objects. 
The Plot class is used to create an immutable object representation of a 
visualization and has the following methods:
- `show`: A method for displaying the Plot object.
- `save`: A method for saving the Plot object in a vega representation.

The `show` method, available on data structures in Turi Create as well as at 
the top level in the namespace, streamlines the process of creating and 
subsequently calling `show` on an automatically-selected Plot object.

Furthermore, Turi Create provides functionality to create independent plots 
like scatter plots, categorical heatmaps, box plots, heatmaps, 
columnwise summaries, and item frequency plots using the following API:

- scatter(x, y, xlabel, ylabel, title)
- categorical_heatmap(x, y, xlabel, ylabel, title)
- heatmap(x, y, xlabel, ylabel, title)
- box_plot(x, y, xlabel, ylabel, title)
- columnwise_summary(sf)
- histogram(sa, xlabel, ylabel, title)
- item_frequency(sa, xlabel, ylabel, title)

For more detailed information, please refer to the docstrings for each of 
those classes/methods.
