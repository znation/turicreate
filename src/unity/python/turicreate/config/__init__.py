    Notes
    -----
    The following section documents all the Turi Create environment variables
    that can be configured.

    **Basic Configuration Variables**

    - *TURI_NUM_GPUS*: Number of GPUs to use when applicable. Set to 0 to force
      CPU use in all situations.

    - *TURI_CACHE_FILE_LOCATIONS*: The directory in which intermediate
      SFrames/SArray are stored.  For instance "/var/tmp".  Multiple
      directories can be specified separated by a colon (ex: "/var/tmp:/tmp")
      in which case intermediate SFrames will be striped across both
      directories (useful for specifying multiple disks).  Defaults to /var/tmp
      if the directory exists, /tmp otherwise.

    - *TURI_FILEIO_MAXIMUM_CACHE_CAPACITY*: The maximum amount of memory which
      will be occupied by *all* intermediate SFrames/SArrays. Once this limit
      is exceeded, SFrames/SArrays will be flushed out to temporary storage (as
      specified by `TURI_CACHE_FILE_LOCATIONS`). On large systems increasing
      this as well as `TURI_FILEIO_MAXIMUM_CACHE_CAPACITY_PER_FILE` can improve
      performance significantly. Defaults to 2147483648 bytes (2GB).

    - *TURI_FILEIO_MAXIMUM_CACHE_CAPACITY_PER_FILE*: The maximum amount of
      memory which will be occupied by any individual intermediate
      SFrame/SArray.  Once this limit is exceeded, the SFrame/SArray will be
      flushed out to temporary storage (as specified by
      `TURI_CACHE_FILE_LOCATIONS`). On large systems, increasing this as well
      as `TURI_FILEIO_MAXIMUM_CACHE_CAPACITY` can improve performance
      significantly for large SFrames. Defaults to 134217728 bytes (128MB).

    **S3 Configuration**

    - *TURI_S3_ENDPOINT*: The S3 Endpoint to connect to. If not specified AWS
      S3 is assumed.

    **SSL Configuration**

    - *TURI_FILEIO_ALTERNATIVE_SSL_CERT_FILE*: The location of an SSL
      certificate file used to validate HTTPS / S3 connections. Defaults to the
      the Python certifi package certificates.

    - *TURI_FILEIO_ALTERNATIVE_SSL_CERT_DIR*: The location of an SSL
      certificate directory used to validate HTTPS / S3 connections. Defaults
      to the operating system certificates.

    - *TURI_FILEIO_INSECURE_SSL_CERTIFICATE_CHECKS*: If set to a non-zero
      value, disables all SSL certificate validation.  Defaults to False.

    **Sort Performance Configuration**

    - *TURI_SFRAME_SORT_PIVOT_ESTIMATION_SAMPLE_SIZE*: The number of random
      rows to sample from the SFrame to estimate the sort pivots used to
      partition the sort. Defaults to 2000000.

    - *TURI_SFRAME_SORT_BUFFER_SIZE*: The maximum estimated memory consumption
      sort is allowed to use. Increasing this will increase the size of each
      sort partition, and will increase performance with increased memory
      consumption.  Defaults to 2GB.

    **Join Performance Configuration**

    - *TURI_SFRAME_JOIN_BUFFER_NUM_CELLS*: The maximum number of cells to
      buffer in memory. Increasing this will increase the size of each join
      partition and will increase performance with increased memory
      consumption.  If you have very large cells (very long strings for
      instance), decreasing this value will help decrease memory consumption.
      Defaults to 52428800.

    **Groupby Aggregate Performance Configuration**

    - *TURI_SFRAME_GROUPBY_BUFFER_NUM_ROWS*: The number of groupby keys cached
      in memory. Increasing this will increase performance with increased
      memory consumption. Defaults to 1048576.

    **Advanced Configuration Variables**

    - *TURI_SFRAME_FILE_HANDLE_POOL_SIZE*: The maximum number of file handles
      to use when reading SFrames/SArrays.  Once this limit is exceeded, file
      handles will be recycled, reducing performance. This limit should be
      rarely approached by most SFrame/SArray operations. Large SGraphs however
      may create a large a number of SFrames in which case increasing this
      limit may improve performance (You may also need to increase the system
      file handle limit with "ulimit -n").  Defaults to 128.
