/** The default server initializer function.

 *  which then determines what models are packaged in the framework and
 *  available from the C-API.
 *
 *  In some cases, it may be desirable to have a custom server initializer, for
 *  example if only a subset of the models are needed.  In this case, define the
 *  macro CAPI_DISABLE_DEFAULT_SERVER_INITIALIZER and create a custom
 *  implementation of that function to be compiled in.  In addition, the CMakeLists.txt
