The graph analytics toolkit contains methods for analyzing a
:class:`~turicreate.SGraph`. Each method takes an input graph and returns a model
object, which contains the training time, an :class:`~turicreate.SFrame` with the
desired output for each vertex, and a new graph whose vertices contain the
output as an attribute. Note that all of the methods in the graph analytics
toolkit are available from the top level turicreate import.

For this example we download a dataset of James Bond characters to an
SFrame, then build the SGraph.

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> from turicreate import SFrame, SGraph
    >>> url = 'https://static.turi.com/datasets/bond/bond_edges.csv'
    >>> data = SFrame.read_csv(url)
    >>> g = SGraph().add_edges(data, src_field='src', dst_field='dst')

The :py:func:`degree_counting.create()
<turicreate.degree_counting.create>` method computes the inbound, outbound,
and total degree for each vertex.

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> from turicreate import degree_counting
    >>> deg = degree_counting.create(g)
    >>> deg_graph = deg['graph'] # a new SGraph with degree data attached to each vertex
    >>> in_degree = deg_graph.vertices[['__id', 'in_degree']]
    >>> out_degree = deg_graph.vertices[['__id', 'out_degree']]

The :py:func:`connected_components.create()
<turicreate.connected_components.create>` method finds all weakly connected
components in the graph and returns a
:py:class:`ConnectedComponentsModel<turicreate.connected_components.ConnectedComponentsModel>`.
A connected component is a group of vertices such that
there is a path between each vertex in the component and all other vertices in
the group. If two vertices are in different connected components there is no
path between them.

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> from turicreate import connected_components
    >>> cc = connected_components.create(g)
    >>> print cc.summary()

    >>> cc_ids = cc.get('component_id')  # an SFrame
    >>> cc_ids = cc['component_id']      # equivalent to the above line
    >>> cc_graph = cc['graph']

The :py:func:`shortest_path.create() <turicreate.shortest_path.create>`
method finds the shortest directed path distance from a single source vertex to
all other vertices and returns a
:py:class:`ShortestPathModel<turicreate.shortest_path.ShortestPathModel>`.
The output model contains this information and a method to
retrieve the actual path to a particular vertex.

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> from turicreate import shortest_path
    >>> sp = shortest_path.create(g, source_vid=123)
    >>> sp_sframe = sp['distance']
    >>> sp_graph = sp['graph']
    >>> path = sp.get_path('98')

The :py:func:`triangle_counting.create() <turicreate.triangle_counting.create>`
counts the number of triangles in the graph and for each vertex and returns
a :py:class:`TriangleCountingModel<turicreate.triangle_counting.TriangleCountingModel>`.
A graph triangle is a complete subgraph of three vertices. The number of
triangles to which a vertex belongs is an indication of the connectivity of the
graph around that vertex.

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> from turicreate import triangle_counting
    >>> tc = triangle_counting.create(g)
    >>> tc_out = tc['triangle_count']

The :py:func:`pagerank.create() <turicreate.pagerank.create>` method computes
the pagerank for each vertex and returns a :py:class:`PagerankModel<turicreate.pagerank.PagerankModel>`.
The pagerank value indicates the centrality of each node in the graph.

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> from turicreate import pagerank
    >>> pr = pagerank.create(g)
    >>> pr_out = pr['pagerank']

The :py:func:`label_propagation.create() <turicreate.label_propagation.create>`
method computes the label probability for the vertices with unobserved labels
by propagating information from the vertices with observed labels along the edges.
The method returns a :py:class:`LabelPropagationModel<turicreate.label_propagation.LabelPropagationModel>`,
which contains the probability that a vertex belongs to each of the label classes.

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> from turicreate import label_propagation
    >>> import random
    >>> def init_label(vid):
    ...     x = random.random()
    ...     if x > 0.9:
    ...         return 0
    ...     elif x < 0.1:
    ...         return 1
    ...     else:
    ...         return None
    >>> g.vertices['labels'] = g.vertices['__id'].apply(init_label, int)
    >>> m = label_propagation.create(g)
    >>> labels = m['labels']


The K-core decomposition recursively removes vertices from the graph with degree
less than k. The value of k where a vertex is removed is its core ID; the
:py:func:`kcore.create() <turicreate.kcore.create>` method returns
a :py:class:`KcoreModel<turicreate.kcore.KcoreModel>` which contains the core ID for
every vertex in the graph.

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> from turicreate import kcore
    >>> kc = kcore.create(g)
    >>> kcore_id = kc['core_id']

Graph coloring assigns each vertex in the graph to a group in such a way that no
two adjacent vertices share the same group.
:py:func:`graph_coloring.create() <turicreate.graph_coloring.create>` method returns
a :py:class:`GraphColoringModel<turicreate.graph_coloring.GraphColoringModel>` which contains
the color group ID for every vertex in the graph.

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> from turicreate import graph_coloring
    >>> color = graph_coloring.create(g)
    >>> color_id = color['color_id']
    >>> num_colors = color['num_colors']
