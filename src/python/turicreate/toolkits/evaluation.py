def log_loss(targets, predictions, index_map=None):
    r"""
    Compute the logloss for the given targets and the given predicted
    probabilities. This quantity is defined to be the negative of the sum
    of the log probability of each observation, normalized by the number of
    observations:

    .. math::

        \textrm{logloss} = - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i \in 1,\ldots,N}
            (y_i \log(p_i) + (1-y_i)\log(1-p_i)) ,

    where y_i is the i'th target value and p_i is the i'th predicted
    probability.

    For multiclass situations, the definition is a slight generalization of the
    above:

    .. math::

        \textrm{logloss} = - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i \in 1,\ldots,N}
            \sum_{j \in 1, \ldots, L}
            (y_{ij} \log(p_{ij})) ,

    where :math:`L` is the number of classes and :math:`y_{ij}` indicates that
    observation `i` has class label `j`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    targets : SArray
        Ground truth class labels. This can either contain integers or strings.

    predictions : SArray
        The predicted probability that corresponds to each target value. For
        binary classification, the probability corresponds to the probability
        of the "positive" label being predicted. For multi-class
        classification, the predictions are expected to be an array of
        predictions for each class.

    index_map : dict[int], [None (default)]
        For binary classification, a dictionary mapping the two target labels to
        either 0 (negative) or 1 (positive). For multi-class classification, a
        dictionary mapping potential target labels to the associated index into
        the vectors in ``predictions``.

    Returns
    -------
    out : float
        The log_loss.

    See Also
    --------
    accuracy

    Notes
    -----
     - For binary classification, when the target label is of type "string",
       then the labels are sorted alphanumerically and the largest label is
       chosen as the "positive" label.  For example, if the classifier labels
       are {"cat", "dog"}, then "dog" is chosen as the positive label for the
       binary classification case. This behavior can be overridden by providing
       an explicit ``index_map``.
     - For multi-class classification, when the target label is of type
       "string", then the probability vector is assumed to be a vector of
       probabilities of classes as sorted alphanumerically. Hence, for the
       probability vector [0.1, 0.2, 0.7] for a dataset with classes "cat",
       "dog", and "rat"; the 0.1 corresponds to "cat", the 0.2 to "dog" and the
       0.7 to "rat". This behavior can be overridden by providing an explicit
       ``index_map``.
     - Logloss is undefined when a probability value p = 0, or p = 1.  Hence,
       probabilities are clipped to max(EPSILON, min(1 - EPSILON, p)) where
       EPSILON = 1e-15.

    For binary classification, when the target label is of type "string", then
    the labels are sorted alphanumerically and the largest label is chosen as
    the "positive" label.

        log_loss = tc.evaluation.log_loss(targets, predictions)

    In the multi-class setting, log-loss requires a vector of probabilities
    (that sum to 1) for each class label in the input dataset. In this example,
    there are three classes [0, 1, 2], and the vector of probabilities
    correspond to the probability of prediction for each of the three classes.

    corresponds to "cat", the 0.2 to "dog" and the 0.7 to "rat".

    average : string, [None, 'micro' (default), 'macro']
        Metric averaging strategies for multiclass classification. Averaging
        strategies can be one of the following:

            - None: No averaging is performed and a single metric is returned
              for each class.
            - 'micro': Calculate metrics globally by counting the total true
              positives, false negatives and false positives.
            - 'macro': Calculate metrics for each label, and find their
              unweighted mean. This does not take label imbalance into account.

        For a more precise definition of `micro` and `macro` averaging refer
        to [1] below.

    Returns
    -------
    out : float (for binary classification) or dict[float] (for multi-class, average=None)
        Score for the positive class (for binary classification) or an average
        score for each class for multi-class classification.  If

def fbeta_score(targets, predictions, beta=1.0, average='macro'):
    r"""
    Compute the F-beta score. The F-beta score is the weighted harmonic mean of
    precision and recall. The score lies in the range [0,1] with 1 being ideal
    and 0 being the worst.

    The `beta` value is the weight given to `precision` vs `recall` in the
    combined score. `beta=0` considers only precision, as `beta` increases, more
    weight is given to recall with `beta > 1` favoring recall over precision.

    The F-beta score is defined as:

        .. math::
            f_{\beta} = (1 + \beta^2) \times \frac{(p \times r)}{(\beta^2 p + r)}

    Where :math:`p` is the precision and :math:`r` is the recall.

    Parameters
    ----------
    targets : SArray
        An SArray of ground truth class labels. Can be of any type except
        float.

    predictions : SArray
        The prediction that corresponds to each target value.  This SArray must
        have the same length as ``targets`` and must be of the same type
        as the ``targets`` SArray.

    beta: float
        Weight of the `precision` term in the harmonic mean.

    Returns
    -------
    out : float (for binary classification) or dict[float] (for multi-class, average=None)
        Score for the positive class (for binary classification) or an average
        score for each class for multi-class classification.  If
        `average=None`, then a dictionary is returned where the key is the
        class label and the value is the score for the corresponding class
        label.

    Notes
    -----
     - For binary classification, if the target label is of type "string",
       then the labels are sorted alphanumerically and the largest label is
       chosen as the "positive" label.  For example, if the classifier labels
       are {"cat", "dog"}, then "dog" is chosen as the positive label for the
       binary classification case.

def f1_score(targets, predictions, average='macro'):
    r"""
    Compute the F1 score (sometimes known as the balanced F-score or
    F-measure). The F1 score is commonly interpreted as the average of
    precision and recall. The score lies in the range [0,1] with 1 being ideal
    and 0 being the worst.

    The F1 score is defined as:

        .. math::
            f_{1} = \frac{2 \times p \times r}{p + r}

    Where :math:`p` is the precision and :math:`r` is the recall.

    Parameters
    ----------
    targets : SArray
        An SArray of ground truth class labels. Can be of any type except
        float.

    predictions : SArray
        The class prediction that corresponds to each target value. This SArray
        must have the same length as ``targets`` and must be of the same type
        as the ``targets`` SArray.

    average : string, [None, 'macro' (default), 'micro']
        Metric averaging strategies for multiclass classification. Averaging
        strategies can be one of the following:

            - None: No averaging is performed and a single metric is returned
              for each class.
            - 'micro': Calculate metrics globally by counting the total true
              positives, false negatives and false positives.
            - 'macro': Calculate metrics for each label, and find their
              unweighted mean. This does not take label imbalance into account.

        For a more precise definition of `micro` and `macro` averaging refer
        to [1] below.

    Returns
    -------
    out : float (for binary classification) or dict[float] (multi-class, average=None)
        Score for the positive class (for binary classification) or an average
        score for each class for multi-class classification.  If
        `average=None`, then a dictionary is returned where the key is the
        class label and the value is the score for the corresponding class
        label.

    See Also
    --------
    confusion_matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, fbeta_score

    Notes
    -----
     - For binary classification, when the target label is of type "string",
       then the labels are sorted alphanumerically and the largest label is
       chosen as the "positive" label.  For example, if the classifier labels
       are {"cat", "dog"}, then "dog" is chosen as the positive label for the
       binary classification case.

    Parameters
    ----------
    targets : SArray
        An SArray containing the observed values. For binary classification,
        the alpha-numerically first category is considered the reference
        category.

    predictions : SArray
        The prediction that corresponds to each target value.  This vector must
        have the same length as ``targets``. Target scores, can either be
        probability estimates of the positive class, confidence values, or
        binary decisions.

    average : string, [None (default)]
        Metric averaging strategies for multiclass classification. Averaging
        strategies can be one of the following:

            - None: No averaging is performed and a single metric is returned

    index_map : dict[int], [None (default)]
        For binary classification, a dictionary mapping the two target labels to
        either 0 (negative) or 1 (positive). For multi-class classification, a
        dictionary mapping potential target labels to the associated index into
        the vectors in ``predictions``.

    Returns
    -------
    out : SFrame
        Each row represents the predictive performance when using a given
        cutoff threshold, where all predictions above that cutoff are
        considered "positive". Four columns are used to describe the
        performance:

            - tpr   : True positive rate, the number of true positives divided by the number of positives.
            - fpr   : False positive rate, the number of false positives divided by the number of negatives.
            - p     : Total number of positive values.
            - n     : Total number of negative values.
            - class : Reference class for this ROC curve.

    Notes
    -----
     - For binary classification, when the target label is of type "string",
       then the labels are sorted alphanumerically and the largest label is
       chosen as the "positive" label.  For example, if the classifier labels
       are {"cat", "dog"}, then "dog" is chosen as the positive label for the
       binary classification case. This behavior can be overridden by providing
       an explicit ``index_map``.
     - For multi-class classification, when the target label is of type
       "string", then the probability vector is assumed to be a vector of
       probabilities of classes as sorted alphanumerically. Hence, for the
       probability vector [0.1, 0.2, 0.7] for a dataset with classes "cat",
       "dog", and "rat"; the 0.1 corresponds to "cat", the 0.2 to "dog" and the
       0.7 to "rat". This behavior can be overridden by providing an explicit
       ``index_map``.
     - The ROC curve is computed using a binning approximation with 1M bins and
       is hence accurate only to the 5th decimal.

def auc(targets, predictions, average='macro', index_map=None):
    r"""
    Compute the area under the ROC curve for the given targets and predictions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    targets : SArray
        An SArray containing the observed values. For binary classification,
        the alpha-numerically first category is considered the reference
        category.

    predictions : SArray
        Prediction probability that corresponds to each target value. This must
        be of same length as ``targets``.

    average : string, [None, 'macro' (default)]
        Metric averaging strategies for multiclass classification. Averaging
        strategies can be one of the following:

            - None: No averaging is performed and a single metric is returned
              for each class.
            - 'macro': Calculate metrics for each label, and find their
              unweighted mean. This does not take label imbalance into account.

    index_map : dict[int], [None (default)]
        For binary classification, a dictionary mapping the two target labels to
        either 0 (negative) or 1 (positive). For multi-class classification, a
        dictionary mapping potential target labels to the associated index into
        the vectors in ``predictions``.

    Returns
    -------
    out : float (for binary classification) or dict[float]
        Score for the positive class (for binary classification) or an average
        score for each class for multi-class classification.  If
        `average=None`, then a dictionary is returned where the key is the
        class label and the value is the score for the corresponding class
        label.

    Examples
    --------
    .. sourcecode:: python

        >>> targets = turicreate.SArray([0, 1, 1, 0])
        >>> predictions = turicreate.SArray([0.1, 0.35, 0.7, 0.99])

        # Calculate the auc-score
        >>> auc =  turicreate.evaluation.auc(targets, predictions)
        0.5

    This metric also works when the targets are strings (Here "cat" is chosen
    as the reference class).

    .. sourcecode:: python

        >>> targets = turicreate.SArray(["cat", "dog", "dog", "cat"])
        >>> predictions = turicreate.SArray([0.1, 0.35, 0.7, 0.99])

        # Calculate the auc-score
        >>> auc =  turicreate.evaluation.auc(targets, predictions)
        0.5


    For the multi-class setting, the auc-score can be averaged.

    .. sourcecode:: python

        # Targets and Predictions
        >>> targets     = turicreate.SArray([ 1, 0, 2, 1])

        {0: 1.0, 1: 1.0, 2: 0.6666666666666666}
