The Turi Create classifier toolkit contains models for classification
problems. Currently, we support binary classification using support vector
machines (SVM), logistic regression, boosted trees, and nearest
neighbors. In addition to these models, we provide a smart interface that
selects the right model based on the data. If you are unsure about which model
to use, simply use :meth:`~turicreate.classifier.create` function.

Training datasets should contain a column for the 'target' variable and one or
more columns representing feature variables.

.. sourcecode:: python

    # Set up the data
    >>> import turicreate as tc
    >>> data =  tc.SFrame('https://static.turi.com/datasets/regression/houses.csv')

    # Create the model
    >>> data['is_expensive'] = data['price'] > 30000
    >>> model = tc.classifier.create(data, target='is_expensive',
    ...                              features=['bath', 'bedroom', 'size'])

    # Make predictions and evaluate results.
    >>> classification = model.classify(data)
    >>> results = model.evaluate(data)
