This module provides utilities for doing text processing.

Note that standard utilities in the `text_analytics` package can be used for
transforming text data into "bag of words" format, where a document is
represented as a dictionary mapping unique words with the number of times that
word occurs in the document. See :py:func:`~turicreate.text_analytics.count_words`
for more details. Also, see :py:func:`~turicreate.SFrame.pack_columns` and
:py:func:`~turicreate.SFrame.unstack` for ways of creating SArrays
containing dictionary types.

We provide methods for learning topic models, which can be useful for modeling
large document collections. See
:py:func:`~turicreate.topic_model.create` for more, as well as the
`text analysis chapter of the User Guide
<https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/userguide/text/README.html>`_.
