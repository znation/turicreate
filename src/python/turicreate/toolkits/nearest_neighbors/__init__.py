The Turi Create nearest neighbors toolkit finds the rows in a tabular
reference dataset that are most similar to a set of queries with the same
schema.

A :py:class:`~turicreate.nearest_neighbors.NearestNeighborsModel` is created with
a reference dataset contained in an :class:`~turicreate.SFrame`, a distance
function, and an indexing method (the latter two options can be done
automatically by the model). An instantiated model has two key methods:
**query**, for finding the closest points in the reference dataset to *new* data
points; and **similarity_graph**, for finding the nearest neighbors of each
point in the original reference set.
