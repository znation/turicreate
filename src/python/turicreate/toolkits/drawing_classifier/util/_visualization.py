def draw_strokes(stroke_based_drawings):
    """
    Visualizes drawings (ground truth or predictions) by
    returning images to represent the stroke-based data from
    the user.

    Parameters
    ----------
    stroke_based_drawings: SArray or list
        An `SArray` of type `list`. Each element in the SArray
        should be a list of strokes, where each stroke is a list
        of points, and each point is represented as a dictionary
        with two keys, "x" and "y". A single stroke-based drawing
        is also supported, in which case, the type of the input
        would be list.

    Returns
    -------
    drawings: SArray or _tc.Image
        Each stroke-based drawing is converted into a 28x28
        grayscale drawing for the user to visualize what their
        strokes traced.
