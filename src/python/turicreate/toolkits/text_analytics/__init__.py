This module provides utilities for doing text processing.

Note that standard SArray utilities can be used for transforming text data
into "bag of words" format, where a document is represented as a
dictionary mapping unique words with the number of times that word occurs
in the document. See :py:func:`~turicreate.text_analytics.count_words`
for more details. Also, see :py:func:`~turicreate.SFrame.pack_columns` and
:py:func:`~turicreate.SFrame.unstack` for ways of creating SArrays
containing dictionary types.

We provide methods for learning topic models, which can be useful for modeling
large document collections. See :py:func:`~turicreate.topic_model.create` for
more info.
