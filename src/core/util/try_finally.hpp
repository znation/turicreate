/**
 * \ingroup util
 * Class to use the garuanteed destructor call of a scoped variable
 *   to simulate a try...finally block.  This is the standard C++ way
 *   of doing that.
 *
 *   Use:
 *
 *   When you want to ensure something is executed, even when
 *   exceptions are present, create a scoped_finally structure and add
 *   the appropriate cleanup functions to it.  When this structure
 *   goes out of scope, either due to an exception or the code leaving
 *   that scope, these functions are executed.
 *
 *   This is useful for cleaning up locks, etc.
