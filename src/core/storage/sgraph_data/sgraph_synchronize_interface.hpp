/**
 * Defines the interface for serializing vertex data and edge data
 * of an sgraph.
 *
 * The main application of this is for communication of graph information.
 *
 * \ref vertex_partition_exchange is the struct that can hold
 * a subset data of a subset of vertices from a sgraph partition.
 *
 * The choice for sparse vertices packing is motivated by the
 * "triple_apply" computation pattern:
 * as we process each edge partition, the associated vertex partition
 * are sparsely visited and updated.
 *
 * \ref sgraph_synchronize_interface is used for both ends of the communication
 * to deal with initialization, sending and receiving the vertex and edge exchange data.
 *
 * Example:
 * \code
 *
 * ////  Worker side ////
 * sgraph_synchronize_interface* worker_graph_sync; // a client side implementation
 *
 * // initialize vertex data in partition 0, using all_vertices sent from server.
 * worker_graph_sync.load_vertex_partition(0, all_vertices_from_server);
 *
 * // recevie a vertex_exchange from server, let's update the local vertices
 * worker_graph_sync->update_vertex_partition(vexchange_from_server);
 *
 * // do some work to update vertex data in partition 0, and obtain a set of changed vertex data..
 * vertex_exchange updated_vertices = worker_graph_sync->get_vertex_partition_exchange(0);
 *
 * // now we can send updated_vertices to the server.
 *
 * //// Server side ////
 * sgraph_synchronize_interface* server_graph_sync; // a server side implementation
 *
 * // call to worker to initialize vertex partition.
 *
 * // recevie a vertex_exchange server, let's update the local vertices
 * server_graph_sync->update_vertex_partition(vexchange_from_client);
 *
 * // do some work to update vertex data in partition 0, and obtain a set of changed vertex data..
 * vertex_exchange updated_vertices = server_graph_sync->get_vertex_partition_exchange(0);
 *
 * // now we can send updated_vertices to the worker.
 *
 * \endcode
