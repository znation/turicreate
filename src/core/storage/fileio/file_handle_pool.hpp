/**
 * \ingroup fileio
 * A global file lifespan manager that manages life time for non temporary files
 * that are currently in use by any SArray(including the array index file and the
 * segment files).
 *
 * Permanent files used by SArray can be removed when user saves a SArray to a
 * directory where there is already a SArray saved there. In case there is some
 * SArray actively referencing the files in the directory, we will delay deletion
 * of those files until nobody is referencing those files. new files will be
 * created under the directory to save the new SArray and the directory index
 * will correctly point to the new files.
 *
 * A file_handle object is created for each file that is in use by SArray. All
 * SArrays referencing those files keep a shared pointer to the file handle object.
 * On reading from a directory, SAray registers the files with global file_handle_pool,
 * When SArray is out of scope, the corresponding ref to the file_handle is removed.
 * Once all ref of a given file_handle goes away, the files may or may not be deleted
 * depend on whether or not the files are overwritten.
 *
 * The pool itself keeps a weak pointer to the file_handle object so the files can
 * be deleted when all SArrays referencing the file are gone.
