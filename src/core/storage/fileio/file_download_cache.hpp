 * \ingroup fileio
 * Provides URL download and caching capabilities.
 * \ref file_download_cache::get_instance() provides a singleton instance of
 * the file_download_cache. Using the file_download_cache simply involves
 * calling the \ref file_download_cache::get_file function which take as its
 * first argument, a general URL (s3, https, http, file, etc) and returns
 * a local file name which can be used to access the file downloaded from the
 * URL.
 *
 * The file_download_cache will cache all the temporary files and avoid
 * re-downloading identical URLs. \ref file_download_cache::release_cache
 * can be used to force a file to be uncached.
 *
 * \ref get_file() is safe to use concurrently. \ref release_cache() has to be
 * used carefully since there are race condition concerns if the downloaded
 * file is still being used by another thread.
 *
 * For s3 files, cache will be updated based on last modification time.
