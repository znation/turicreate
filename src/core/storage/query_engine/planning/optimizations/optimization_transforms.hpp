/**
 *  Optimization transforms are successively applied until no more
 *  optimizations are possible.  A queue of active nodes is maintained,
 *  starting with all nodes in the planner graph.
 *
 *  The transforms are indexed by type; for each node in the planner
 *  graph, all transformations that apply to that planner node type
 *  are attempted in order of declaration.  If no transformations
 *  apply to a node, then it is discarded from the active queue.
 *
 *  If apply_transform returns true, then the optimization for that
 *  node is stopped.  If apply_transform returns false, then it is
 *  assumed that the transformation did not apply, and the next
 *  transformation is attempted.
 *
 *  Changes to the graph coming as a result of transformations should
 *  call the appropriate method in the optimization_engine.  All
 *  intrinsic graph operations required to maintain the graph
 *  consistently are done internally by these nodes, including
 *  requeueing all affected nodes on the active queue.
 *
 *  All new transformations need to be registered in
 *  populate_transforms() inside optimization_transforms.cpp.
