/**
 * This class implements a completely unfair lock.
 *
 * The basic mechanic of operation is that every thread is assigned a
 * priority ID (this is via a thread local variable) (rant if apple compiler
 * has proper C++11 support this would just be using the thread_local keyword.
 * But we don't. So it is this annoying boilerplate around pthread_getspecific.).
 *
 * Then if many threads are contending for the lock, the lock will always go to
 * the thread with the lowest priority ID.
 *
 * Furthermore, the lock has a parameterized "stickiness". In other words, when
 * a thread releases the lock, it is granted a certain time window in which
 * if it (or a lower ID thread) returns to acquire the lock, it will be able to
 * get it immediately. This "stickness" essentially parameterizes the
 * CPU-utilization Disk-utilization balance. The more IO bound a task is, the
 * better it is for it to be executed on just one CPU. This threshold attempts
 * to self-tune by trying to maximize the total throughput of the lock.
 * (i.e.. maximising lock acquisitions per second). This is done by gradually
 * adapting the sleep interval: i.e. if increasing it increases throughput,
 * it gets increases, and vice versa.
