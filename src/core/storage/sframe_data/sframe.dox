 * The SFrame Physical Format describes how SFrames are laid out on disk.
 * The actual format is a bit ... complicated since it really grew organically.
 * Hence unfortunately, the documentation is the code itself.
 *
 * For a user of the SFrame, the main collection of objects that matter is
 * in \ref sframe_main.
