 * Provides a Python interface to incrementally build an SFrame.

 * "sframe_builder" class, but provides the implementation. This is because it
 * is a slightly embellished wrapper around the SArray's output iterator, so
 * there is no further functionality that needs to be available for the C++
 * side.
 *
 * The unity_sframe_builder is designed to append values until \ref close is
 * called, which returns the SFrame. No "reopening" is allowed, and no
 * operations in that instance of unity_sframe_builder will work after close is
 * called.
 *
 * This also doesn't wrap the already existing \ref unity_sarray_builder
 * despite its similarity, because using the sframe output iterator allows for
 * multiple columns to be kept in the same file.
