/**
 * \ingroup nanosockets
 *
 * A nanomsg asynchronous reply socket.
 *
 * The Asynchronous reply socket is the target endpoint of the the
 * asynchronous request socket (\ref async_request_socket). The reply socket
 * listens on an endpoint, and the request socket sends requests to an endpoint.
 * Endpoints are standard Zeromq style endpoint addresses , for instance,
 * tcp://[ip]:[port], or ipc://[filename] (interprocess socket) or
 * inproc://[handlename] (inprocess socket).
 * Ipc sockets are emulated on windows using TCP.
 *
 * The asynchronous reply socket is constructed with a callback which is
 * called whenever a request is received. The callback may be called in
 * parallel; up to the value of nthreads. For instance, a simple echo service
 * can be built with:
 *
 * \code
 * void echo(zmq_msg_vector& recv, zmq_msg_vector& reply) {
 *   reply = recv;
 * }
 * async_reply_socket sock(echo, 4, "ipc:///tmp/echo_service")
 * sock.start_polling();
 * \endcode
 *
 * All messaging is done via \ref zmq_msg_vector which is internally, an array
 * of nn_msg_t objects. Message boundaries are preserved across the wire; i.e.
 * if a request of 4 messages is sent, we will receive exactly a zmq_msg_vector
 * of 4 messages.
 *
 * Also, \see async_request_socket
