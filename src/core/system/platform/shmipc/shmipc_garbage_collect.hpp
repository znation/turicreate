 * Internally, the RAII deleter contains a pair of a shared memory filename and
 * a "tag" filename which is used to indicate that the shared memory file
 * exists.  The tag filename is used in shared memory garbage collection and is
 * located as [system temp directory]/glshm_[userid]/[shmname]
 *
 * The reason for having a directory for each userid is to avoid permission
 * issues. Each tag file contains inside of it, the PID of the server process.
