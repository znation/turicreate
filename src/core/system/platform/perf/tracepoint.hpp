/**
 * \defgroup perfmonitoring Intrusive Performance Monitoring
 * \brief A tracepoint utility that provides intrusive (requires code change) performance monitoring.
 *
 * The tracepoint utility provides a extremely low overhead way of profiling a
 * section of code, counting the number of times the section is entered, the
 * average, maximum and mimimum runtimes of the section.
 *
 * The tracepoint utility can be enabled file by file, or in an entire project by
 * setting the USE_TRACEPOINT macro before including tracepoint.hpp, or
 * predefining USE_TRACEPOINT globally.
 * \code
 * #define USE_TRACEPOINT
 * #include "perf/tracepoint.hpp"
 * \endcode
 *
 * Example Usage:
 * \code
 *    DECLARE_TRACER(event)
 *    INITIALIZE_TRACER(event, "event counter name");
 *    Then later on...
 *    BEGIN_TRACEPOINT(event)
 *    ... Do stuff ...
 *    END_TRACEPOINT(event)
 * \endcode
 * See \ref DECLARE_TRACER for details.

/**
 * \ingroup perfmonitoring
 * \def DECLARE_TRACER(name)
 * Creates a tracing object with a given name. This creates a variable
 * called "name" which is of type trace_count. and is equivalent to:
 *
 * turi::trace_count name;
 *
 * The primary reason to use this macro instead of just writing
 * the code above directly, is that the macro is ignored and compiles
 * to nothing when tracepoints are disabled.
 *
 * Example Usage:
 * \code
 *    DECLARE_TRACER(event)
 *    INITIALIZE_TRACER(event, "event counter name");
 *    Then later on...
 *    BEGIN_TRACEPOINT(event)
 *    ... Do stuff ...
 *    END_TRACEPOINT(event)
 * \endcode
 *
 * There are some minor caveats. BEGIN_TRACEPOINT really declares a variable,
 * so you must begin and end a tracepoint within the same scope, and you cannot
 * call BEGIN_TRACEPOINT on the same event within the same scope.
 *
 * At program termination the contents of the tracepoint will be emitted.
 * It will print the number times the tracepoint is entered, the total
 * program time spent in the tracepoint, as well as average, minimum and
 * maximum time spent in the tracepoint. Note that the tracepoint
 * is safe to use even when running in parallel. The total time spent in the
 * tracepoint is hence the sum over all threads.
 *
 * The tracepoint uses rdtsc for fast clock cycle counting, hence might be
 * inaccurate on systems where rdtsc is not necessarily monotonic.
