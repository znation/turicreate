/**
 * \ingroup cppipc
 * The client side of the IPC communication system.
 *
 * The comm_client manages the serialization, and the calling of functions
 * on remote machines. The comm_client and the comm_server reaches each other
 * through the use of zookeeper. If both client and server connect to the same
 * zookeeper host, and on construction are provided the same "name", they are
 * connected.
 *
 * The comm_client provides communication capability for the \ref object_proxy
 * objects. Here, we will go through an example of proxying the file_write class
 * described in the \ref comm_server documentation.
 *
 * Basic Utilization
 * -----------------
 * Given a base class file_write_base, which is implemented on the server side,
 * we can construct on the client side, an \ref object_proxy object which
 * creates and binds to an implementation of file_write_base on the server side,
 * and allows function calls across the network.
 *
 * We first repeat the description for the base class here:
 * \code
 * class file_write_base {
 *  public:
 *   virtual int open(std::string s) = 0;
 *   virtual void write(std::string s) = 0;
 *   virtual void close() = 0;
 *   virtual ~file_write_base() {}
 *
 *   REGISTRATION_BEGIN(file_write_base)
 *   REGISTER(file_write_base::open)
 *   REGISTER(file_write_base::write)
 *   REGISTER(file_write_base::close)
 *   REGISTRATION_END
 * };
 * \endcode
 *
 * We can create an object_proxy by templating over the base class, and
 * providing the comm_client object in the constructor.
 * \code
 * object_proxy<file_write_base> proxy(client);
 * \endcode
 * This will create on the remote machine, an instance of the file_write_impl
 * object, and the object_proxy class provides the capability to call functions
 * on the remote object. For instance, to call the "open" function, followed
 * by some "writes" and "close".
 * \code
 * int ret = proxy.call(&file_write_base::open, "log.txt");
 * proxy.call(&file_write_base::write, "hello");
 * proxy.call(&file_write_base::write, "world");
 * proxy.call(&file_write_base::close);
 * \endcode
 * The return type of the proxy.call function will match the return type of the
 * member function pointer provided. For instance, &file_write_base::open
 * returns an integer, and the result is forwarded across the network and
 * returned.
 *
 * On destruction of the proxy object, the remote object is also deleted.
 *
 * Wrapping the Proxy Object
 * -------------------------
 * It might be convenient in many ways to wrap the object_proxy in a way to
 * make it easy to use. This is a convenient pattern that is very useful.
 *
 * For instance, a proxy wrapper for the file_write_base object might look like:
 * \code
 * class file_write_proxy: public file_write_base {
 *  object_proxy<file_write_base> proxy;
 *  public:
 *   file_write_proxy(comm_client& comm): proxy(comm) { }
 *   int open(std::string s) {
 *     return proxy.call(&file_write_base::open, s);
 *   }
 *   void write(std::string s) {
 *     return proxy.call(&file_write_base::write , s);
 *   }
 *   void close() {
 *     return proxy.call(&file_write_base::close);
 *   }
 * };
 * \endcode
 *
 * Preprocessor Magic
 * ------------------
 * To facilitate the creation of base interfaces, calling REGISTER macros
 * appropriately, and implementing the proxy wrapper, we provide the
 * \ref GENERATE_INTERFACE, \ref GENERATE_PROXY and
 * \ref GENERATE_INTERFACE_AND_PROXY magic macros.
 *
 * For instance, to generate the proxy and the base class for the above
 * file_write_base object, we can write
 *
 * \code
 * GENERATE_INTERFACE_AND_PROXY(file_write_base, file_write_proxy,
 *                              (int, open, (std::string))
 *                              (void, write, (std::string))
 *                              (void, close, )
 *                              )
 * \endcode
 *
 * This is the recommended way to create proxy and base objects since this
 * allows a collection of interesting functionality to be injected.
 * For instance, this will allow functions to take base pointers as arguments
 * and return base pointers (for instance file_write_base*). On the client side,
 * proxy objects are serialized in a way so that the server side uses the
 * matching implementation instance. When an object is returned, the object
 * is registered on the server side and converted to a new proxy object
 * on the client side. a
 *
 * Implementation Details
 * ----------------------
 * Many other details regarding safety when interfaces, or interface argument
 * type modifications are described in the \ref comm_server documentation.
 *
 * The comm client internally maintains the complete mapping of all member
 * function pointers to strings. The object_proxy class then has the simple
 * task of just maintaining the object_ids: i.e. what remote object does it
 * connect to.
 *
 * There is a special "root object" which manages all "special" tasks that
 * operate on the comm_server itself. This root object always has object ID 0
 * and is the object_factory_base. This is implemented on the server side by
 * object_factory_impl, and on the client side as object_factory_proxy.
 * The comm_client exposes the object_factory functionality as member functions
 * in the comm_client itself. These are make_object(), ping() and
 * delete_object()
