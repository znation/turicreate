  * The values of srv_running_command are meant to have a range of an unsigned
  * 64-bit integer.  Two values have special meaning:
  *   - A value of 0 means that there is no command currently running.
  *   - A value of uint64_t(-1) means that the currently running command should
  *   be cancelled.
  *
  * NOTE: This design relies on the current fact that the cppipc server will only
  * run one command at a time.  This must be revisited if more than 1 command could
  * possibly be running.
