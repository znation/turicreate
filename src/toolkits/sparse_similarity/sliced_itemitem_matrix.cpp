/** Calculates the number of passes required to go through a symmetric
 *  or triangular matrix with a fixed amount of memory.  To calculate
 *  the number of slices required, as well as the slice boundaries, we
 *  iteratively:
 *
 *   1. Process the first b rows of num_items by num_items matrix.
 *   2. Drop the left most b rows of the matrix.
 *   3. Repeat on remaining (num_items - b) by (num_items - b) matrix.
 *
 *  This allows us to effeciently slice up a large triangular matrix.

 *  For example, if it is a 16 by 16 matrix, with
 *  target_item_count_per_pass = 16, then there would be 11 slices --
 *  the first 8 rows would have to be processed individually, as only
 *  one row of the upper triangular part (including diaganol) would
 *  fit in that 16 elements at a time.  The next two slices would each
 *  consist of 2 rows, as each row would have less than 8 elements in
 *  at a time, and the final 4 x 4 slice can be done in one go.
