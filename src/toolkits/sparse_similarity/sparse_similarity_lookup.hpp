/** A model that can be used for sparse similarity lookup.
 *
 *  A trained version of this model contains a lookup table of the
 *  nearest items to each item along with a similarity score.  This
 *  allows both retrieval of the most similar items to a given item,
 *  and to generate a list of the items most similar to a collection
 *  of items.  The latter is used to recommend items, e.g. by
 *  providing a list of the items and ratings for a particular user.
 *
 *  The similarity metrics are an implementation of a class that
 *  implements a number of methods dictating the math used in the
 *  accumulation.  See similarities.hpp for details.
 *
 *  This model is creating using the create(...) methods below, which
 *  takes the name of the similarity and the current options.  The
 *  options given in add_options(...) must be present in the options
 *  map.
 *
 *  The model can be trained by either providing the similarities of
 *  the items directly, or by training the model on a sarray of
 *  user-item-ratings.  See the below functions for details.
 *
 *
 *  Code Structure:
 *
 * - This model is intended to be encapsulated by other user-facing
 *   models such as item similarity.  In this case, item similarity
 *   provides the user facing API, creates this model and then uses
 *   it.  Some item cf specific features, like how to handle new
 *   users, are punted to that model -- this one only can be queried
 *   with a list of items and ratings which then produce the output.
 *
 * - The similarity class defines the metric used, and then how the
 *   averaging at prediction time is done.
 *
 * - The similarity class is given as a template to the implementation
 *   part of this class, sparse_similarity_lookup_impl, which inherits
 *   from this one.  This class does the training (if it's not farmed
 *   out to different helper functions), and takes care of the
 *   prediction and item scoring.  Basically, the core of the
 *   algorithm is in sparse_similarity_lookup_impl.hpp.
 *
 * - A number of accompaning utilities -- for example, nearest
 *   neighbors functions, utilities to generate the per-item
 *   statistics, and
 *
 * - A dense matrix class that stores only the upper diaganol part of
 *   a matrix is provided in sliced_itemitem_matrix.hpp. Included in
 *   that header are tools for estimating the number of row-slices and
 *   passes through the data to make given constraints on the memory
 *   usage.
 *
