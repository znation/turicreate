 * <b> Toolkit Name: connected_component </b>
 *
 * Accepted Parameters: None
 *
 * Returned Parameters:
 * \li \b training_time (flexible_type: float). The training time of the algorithm in seconds
 * excluding all other preprocessing stages.
 *
 * \li \b num_of_components (flexible_type: int) The number of components of the graph.
 *
 * \li \b __graph__ (unity_graph). The graph object with the field "component_id",
 * The component_id field (integer) on each vertex contains the component ID
 * of the vertex. All vertices with the same component ID are connected.
 * component IDs are not sequential and can be arbitrary integers.
