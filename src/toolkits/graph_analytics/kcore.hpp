/**
 * Obtains the registration for the KCore Toolkit.
 *
 * Performs kcore decomposition on the graph.
 *
 * <b> Toolkit Name: kcore </b>
 *
 * Accepted Parameters:
 * \li \b kmin (flexible_type: integer). The lowest KCore value to compute
 * (inclusive).  Defaults to 0. All vertices with a core value out of this
 * range will have a core ID of -1.
 *
 * \li \b kmax (flexible_type: integer). The highest KCore value to compute
 * (inclusive). Defaults to 100. All vertices with a core value out of this
 * range will have a core ID of -1.
 *
 * Returned Parameters:
 * \li \b training_time (flexible_type: float). The training time of the algorithm in seconds
 * excluding all other preprocessing stages.
 *
 * \li \b max_core The largest core value encountered.
 *
 * \li \b __graph__ (unity_graph). The graph object with the field "core_id",
 * The core_id field (integer) contains the core number of the vertex.
 * This number will be in between kmin amd kmax (inclusive). All vertices with
 * core values outside of this range will have core_id of -1.
