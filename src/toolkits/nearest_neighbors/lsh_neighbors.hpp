/**
 *  LSH nearest neighbor class.
 *
 *  The intuition behind LSH-based indexes is to hash data points into
 *  buckets, such that similar points are more likely to be hashed to the same
 *  bucket than dissimilar ones. We could then find the approximate nearest
 *  neighbors of any point, simply by finding the bucket that it is hashed to.
 *
 *  It works as follows:
 *
 *  1. Choose k hash functions h_1, h_2, ..., h_k from a uniform of some
 *  family of LSH functions. For any data point v, place v in the bucket with
 *  key g(v) = (h_1(v), h_2(v), ..., h_k(v)).
 *  2. Independently perform step 1 l times to construct l separate hash
 *  tables, with hash functions g_1, g_2, ..., g_l
 *
 *  You can set k and l by setting num_projections_per_table and
 *  num_tables respectively.
