/**
 * Ball tree nearest neighbors class
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Implements the ball tree method for k-nearest neighbors search.
 *
 * The ball tree works by partitioning the reference data into into successively
 * smaller balls, and recording the center (i.e. pivot) and radius of each ball.
 * A ball tree query uses the pivots and radii to exclude many of the balls from
 * the k-nearest neighbor search, allowing it to run in sub-linear time.
 *
 * In addition to the objects contained in the nearest_neighbors_model base
 * class, the ball tree contains the following:
 *
 * - membership:
 *     Each element of this vector indicates which node the corresponding
 *     reference data point belongs to. After the tree is constructed, the
 *     elements in this vector correspond to leaf nodes of the tree only.
 *
 * - pivots:
 *     The reference data point at the center of each tree node.
 *
 * - node_radii:
 *     The distance from the pivot of each node to the most distant
 *     reference point belonging to the tree node.
