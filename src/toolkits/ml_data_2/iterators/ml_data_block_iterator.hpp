/**  This iterator acts similarly to the regular ml_data_iterator
 *   class; however, it also enables the user to implement simple
 *   iteration over blocks of rows.  Here, a block is defined by a
 *   collection of rows in which the first value is common.
 *
 *   The ml_data_block_iterator does this by providing two additional
 *   functionalities beyond ml_data_iterator:
 *
 *   1.  is_start_of_new_block() returns true only if the first value
 *   in the current row differs from the first value in the previous
 *   row.  (It is also true at the starting bound of iteration).  Thus
 *   the user knows when to switch to a new block.
 *
 *   2.  If the iteration range is broken up by threads,
 *   i.e. num_threads > 1, then the effective bounds of the partitions
 *   of each individual iterator will always be on the boundaries
 *   between blocks.  Thus parallel iteration will never split a block
 *   between two threads.
 *
 *   In all other respects, this iterator behaves just like
 *   ml_data_iterator.
