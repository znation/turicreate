/**
 * TCMPSInstanceNormDataLoader
 *
 * SUMMARY
 * -------
 * This class override is used by the MPS api to populate the
 * MPSCNNInstanceNormalizationNode node with data. There are a few key methods
 * on this class that the MPS api calls. These are listed below
 *
 * KEY METHODS 
 * -----------
 *
 * - beta, gamma
 *        These methods return the current values for beta and gamma in the
 *        instanceNorm layer. These methods both call checkpointWithCommandQueue
 *        to synchronize the GPU and the CPU weights before returning their
 *        respective values.
 *
 * - checkpointWithCommandQueue
 *        Given a command_queue on a Metal Device we can synchronize resources
 *        from that command_queue. For beta and gamma those might be their
 *        respective values on the GPU, but for training we would also need
 *        momentum and velocity vectors. We therefore synchronize those as well.
 *
 * - updateGammaAndBetaWithCommandBuffer
 *        MPS calls this method and we need to update the gamma and the beta
 *        weights ourselves. To do this we have an adams optimizer for both the
 *        gamma and the beta values. For each value in the batch we don't want
 *        to increment the adam optimizer's time step as the learning rate would
 *        be affected. So we store the timestep at the beginning of each batch
 *        and use it across the batch. This `Hack` makes the behavior of the
 *        weight updates, very similar to the behavior we see in MxNet.
