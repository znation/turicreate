Compiling Turi Create from Source
=================================

Repository Layout
-----------------

Note: Turi Create uses a [cmake out-of-source](https://cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_FAQ#Out-of-source_build_trees)
build. This means that the build itself, and the products of the build, take place outside of the source tree
(in our case in a directory structure parallel to `src/`, etc., but nested one level deeper underneath `debug/` or `release/`).
*Do not edit* any of the files underneath the build output directories, unless you want your changes to get
overwritten on the next build. Make changes in the `src/` directory, and run build commands to produce output.

* `src/`: source code of Turi Create
* `src/unity/python`: the Python module source code
* `src/unity/python/turicreate/test`: Python unit tests for Turi Create
* `src/external`: source drops of 3rd party source dependencies
* `deps/`: build dependencies and environment
* `debug/`, `release/`: build output directories for debug and release builds respectively
* `test/`: C++ unit tests for Turi Create

Build Dependencies
------------------

You will need:

* On macOS, [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835) with command line tools (tested with Xcode 9)
* On Linux, a C++ compiler toolchain with C++11 support
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 6.x or later with `node` and `npm` in `$PATH`
* The python `virtualenv` package.

Turi Create automatically satisfies other dependencies in the `deps/` directory,
which includes compiler support and dependent libraries.

Compiling
---------

    pip install virtualenv

We use virtualenv to install required python packages into the build directory,
be sure to install virtualenv using your system pip (conda pip is not supported)

    ./configure

Running configure will create two sub-directories, `release/` and
`debug/` . cd into `src/unity` under either of these directories and running make will build the
release or the debug versions respectively.

We recommend using makeâ€™s parallel build feature to accelerate the compilation
process. For instance:

    cd debug/src/unity
    make -j 4

will perform up to 4 build tasks in parallel. When building in release mode,
Turi Create does require a large amount of memory to compile with the
heaviest toolkit requiring 1GB of RAM. Where K is the amount of memory you
have on your machine in GB, we recommend not exceeding `make -j K`

To use your dev build export these environment variables:

    source <repo root>/scripts/python_env.sh debug

or 

    source <repo root>/scripts/python_env.sh release

Running Unit Tests
------------------

### Running Python unit tests
From the repo root:

    cd debug/src/unity/python/turicreate/test
    pytest


### Running C++ units
From the repo root:

    cd debug/test
    make
    ctest .
