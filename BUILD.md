Compiling Turi Create from Source
=================================

Repository Layout
-----------------

Note: Turi Create uses a [cmake out-of-source](https://cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_FAQ#Out-of-source_build_trees)
build. This means that the build itself, and the products of the build, take place outside of the source tree
(in our case in a directory structure parallel to `src/`, etc., but nested one level deeper underneath `debug/` or `release/`).
*Do not edit* any of the files underneath the build output directories, unless you want your changes to get
overwritten on the next build. Make changes in the `src/` directory, and run build commands to produce output.

* `src/`: source code of Turi Create
* `src/unity/python`: the Python module source code
* `src/unity/python/turicreate/test`: Python unit tests for Turi Create
* `src/external`: source drops of 3rd party source dependencies
* `deps/`: build dependencies and environment
* `debug/`, `release/`: build output directories for debug and release builds respectively
* `scripts/`: Useful build, test, and repo maintenance scripts
* `test/`: C++ unit tests for Turi Create

Using Docker to build and test for Linux
----------------------------------------

Most of the commands in this repo, including `make_wheel.sh` and `test_wheel.sh`, have optional `--docker-python${VERSION}`
flags to run the build in Docker. This process is fully automated, and uses Docker images created on the fly from the following
docker files:

* `scripts/Dockerfile-Ubuntu-10.04`: used for building (see comments in that file re: GLIBC/GLIBCXX compatibility).
* `scripts/Dockerfile-Ubuntu-14.04`: used for testing Python 2.7 and Python 3.5 wheels.
* `scripts/Dockerfile-Ubuntu-18.04`: used for testing Python 3.6 wheels.

You can start with `./scripts/make_wheel.sh --help` to see available Docker build options.

Build Dependencies
------------------

You will need:

* On macOS, [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835) with command line tools (tested with Xcode 9 and later)
* On Linux:
  * A C++ compiler toolchain with C++11 support (`gcc` >= 4.8 or `clang` >= 3.3)
  * `git` (typically provided by the `git` package)
  * `patch` (typically provided by `patch` package)
  * `rsync` (typically provided by `rsync` package)
  * blas and lapack development libraries (typically provided by the `liblapack-dev` package)
  * `pyfpe.h` (typically provided by the `libpython2.7-dev` package for Python 2.7, or `libpython3.6-dev` for Python 3.6)
  * `gif_lib.h` (typically provided by the `libgif-dev` package)
  * `xxd` (typically provided by the `vim-common` package)
  * For visualization support, X11 libraries (typically provided by `libx11-dev` or `libX11-devel` packages)
* On both macOS and Linux:
  * The python `virtualenv` package
* With Docker:
  * All dependencies are satisfied for you automatically (see "Using Docker" section above).

Optionally, you may want:

* `cmake` (if not present, one will be downloaded and bootstrapped locally).
* `ccache` (speeds up subsequent builds by caching intermediate outputs).

Turi Create automatically satisfies other dependencies in the `deps/` directory,
which includes compiler support and dependent libraries.

Compiling
---------

We use virtualenv to install required python packages into the build directory.
If you don't already have it, you can install it with:

    pip install virtualenv

Note that you may need to do a system-wide install with `sudo`; this depends on your Python environment and whether your `pip` binary requires sudo permissions. Alternately, you could try `pip install --user` to force a user-local installation if `pip install` gives permission denied errors.

Optionally, set a [generator](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/manual/cmake-generators.7.html) for CMake before running `./configure`. Ninja can speed up incremental builds, but is not required.

    # Optional: set a generator
    # The default is "Unix Makefiles"
    export GENERATOR="-G Ninja"

Optionally, set an environment variable named `VIRTUALENV` if you want to use a different virtualenv binary than the default found in your `PATH`. This can allow you to build for multiple Python versions side-by-side on a single machine; note that the Python version that Turi Create is built for will correspond to the Python version of the `virtualenv` binary used.

    # Optional: override VIRTUALENV to point to a different binary
    # For instance, to build for Python 3.6 on a system where
    # /usr/local/bin/virtualenv is using Python 2.7
    export VIRTUALENV=/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin/virtualenv

Then, run `./configure` (optionally with command line arguments to control what is built):

    ./configure

Running `./configure` will create two sub-directories, `release/` and
`debug/` . cd into `src/unity` under either of these directories and running make will build the
release or the debug versions respectively.

We recommend using makeâ€™s parallel build feature to accelerate the compilation
process. For instance:

    cd debug/src/unity
    make -j 4

will perform up to 4 build tasks in parallel. When building in release mode,
Turi Create does require a large amount of memory to compile with the
heaviest toolkit requiring 1GB of RAM. Where K is the amount of memory you
have on your machine in GB, we recommend not exceeding `make -j K`. Note that
if you are using ninja, it uses parallelism by default, and builds all targets
directly from the `debug/` or  `release/` directories.

To use your dev build after a successful build, enter the virtual environment
used for the build:

    source <repo root>/scripts/python_env.sh debug

or 

    source <repo root>/scripts/python_env.sh release

Running Unit Tests
------------------

### Running Python unit tests
From the repo root:

    cd debug/src/unity/python/turicreate/test
    pytest


### Running C++ units
From the repo root:

    cd debug/test
    make
    ctest .
